# vim-railscasts

This is a copy of [jgdavey/vim-railscasts](https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-railscasts).
That repository has some file corruption that causes Git clones to fail when
`git config transfer.fsckobjects` is enabled. I was tired of temporarily disabling that when I
needed to clone the repository, so I'm making this fixed copy instead.

## Original README

This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175

This theme is based on Josh O'Rourke's Vim clone of the railscast
textmate theme ( vimscript #1995 ).  The key thing I have done here is
supply 256-color terminal equivalents for as many of the colors as
possible, and fixed up a few of the funny tags for editing e-mails and
such.
